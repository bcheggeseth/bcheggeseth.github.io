    "text": "Everyone has their own concept of what justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) means to them. I provide the definitions that frame my pedagogical and professional work.\n\nWhat is Diversity?\nThere are many ways in which people differ, both in terms of visiblee and invisible characteristics that influences individual and group identity and life experience. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to, race, ethnicity, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, socio-economic status, language, culture, national origin, religion/spirituality, age, (dis)ability, and military/veteran status.\nWe should celebrate our differences! We benefit from having learning spaces that include a diverse group of individuals and perspectives because our own lived experiences provide a narrow view of the world. We can deepen our understanding of our world, develop more creative and better solutions to important societal problems by having many ideas and approaches expressed.\n\n\nWhat is Equity?\nBut it is not enough for everyone “a seat at the table.” Our society was built on the foundations of colonization and oppression, a caste system, which set the rules to benefit some groups, individuals, and identities over others. We must work to counter uneven social power and white supremacy.\nWe should make sure that everyone has the support and opportunity they need to succeed. Equity does not necessarily mean equal support and opportunity as we do not all experience the same barriers. We must put policies in place to actively respond to systematic racism and other forms of discrimination, bias, and harassment.\n\n\nWhat is an Inclusion?\nInclusion means actively cultivating an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. An inclusive space can only be created once we are more aware of our unconscious biases and the roles we play in the social power dynamics, and have learned and are actively working to counter them.\nOnly with equity and inclusion can a diverse group of individuals thrive.\n\n\nWhat is Justice?\nJustice means dismantling barriers to resources and opportunities in society so that all individuals & communities can live a full & dignified life.\n\n\nWhat is an Inclusive & Equitable Classroom?\nAn inclusive and equitable classroom is a space in which all students feel like they belong; they feel welcomed into the intellectual discussion, supported in their learning, and valued for their ideas and contributions.\nAll students have full access to learning opportunities, and the tools they need to do so successfully and meaningfully.\nStudents are treated fairly and equitably, not necessarily equally, no matter their background and intersecting identities (e.g. race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, ability, age,…)"

    "text": "Work with Ellen Graham ’21, Zuofu Huang ’21, and Kieu-Giang Nguyen ’20 for a summer research project in Summer 2019. This project focused on comparing methods for clustering longitudinal categorical data. The team created a tool for completing cluster analysis on such data using a variety of appropriate clustering methods. For each method, it produces visualizations and statistics to help interpret the clustering assignments. We also allow for comparing different clusters and producing clustering comparison statistics such as the adjusted Rand index. We include two data sets, but users could upload and analyze datasets of their choosing.\nThe original motivating data set for this project was data on healthcare utilization for cancer patients who moved between categories (Home, Hospital, Hospice, Nursing Facility). The goal was to see if we could detect similarities between patients based solely on their patterns of care.\nThis structure also appears in sleep stage data, like those produced by wearable technologies such as FitBit. If wore at night, an wearer is categorized into Wake, Light, Deep, or REM sleep when the device assumes sleep. Kieu-Giang Nguyen continued this project by analyzing this data in an Honor’s Thesis.\nA future continuation of this work is to explore longitudinal patterns of categories in art location and purposes (see [Mia Collaboration]()).\nProducts\n\nShiny App from Summer 2019 team is publicly available to compare methods.\nNguyen, Kieu-Giang, (2020). “Good Night?: Clustering Sleep Stage Data” Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Honors Projects. 50."

Our task was to analyze, contextualize, and visualize its permanent collection data. Our team focused on the location history of each art object and try to highlight the diversity of art and artists on display at the NGA over time.\nWe cleaned, reformatted, and created interactive visualizations on a website that provides access to our explore the diversity spatially and over time.\nThe provided data that tells us whether an object is on public view may not accurately reflect actual practice; our data does not include objects that have been in public view in any rooms currently under revonvation. Any objects that were on public view for at least one day of the chosen month were given equal weight in determining these distributions. Artist gender identities were identified from the Union List of Artist Names (provided by the J. Paul Getty Trust), inferred based on the first name using historical data records, or manually determined by an art historian. These identities may not accurately express the artist’s self-identity. Artist race/ethnicities identities were inferred using nationalities and group identities listed in the Union List of Artist Names (provided by the J. Paul Getty Trust), and the publicly available National Gallery of Art nationalities, which reflect citizenship. These nationalities and identities were grouped using the U.S. Census Bureau definitions of White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and Native and they may not accurately express the artist’s self-identity.\nProducts\n\nInteractive Shiny App: https://bheggeseth.shinyapps.io/DiversityOnDisplay/\nPresentation: Heggeseth, B.

After a two-year follow up, they applied longitudinal growth mixture models (GMM) to detect any associations with declining eGFR patterns. While this statistical approach worked well for a short follow up, it was not as applicable for detecting the underlying cause with a longer 5-year follow up since individuals may start to decline at any point during the study.\nIn collaboration with nephrologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians, I came up with an alternative methodology (details forthcoming in publication) to detect an early kidney injury, the time at which an individual might switch from healthy kidney function to declining, unhealthy kidney function before being clinically diagnosed as having CKD.\nMacalester students, Alex McCreight and Connie Zhang, worked with me to implement this method to investigate potential exposures with early kidney injury. The first paper using this method is currently in review.\nConnie Zhang, in her Honors Thesis, worked to expand the novel method to allow for a bivariate distribution based on eGFR. Continued work is needed to refine this method for early kidney disease detection.\nUsing simulation studies, I am compare the potential conclusions from the original GMM methodology with this alternative method.\nProduct\n\nFirst paper submitted after revise and resubmit decision\nFurther analysis is in progress"

There have been questions in the scholarly community about whether the main tool that they use to measure implicit reactions, the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP), actually measures unintended responses. My contribution to this study was the statistical analysis and interpretation of their analysis. I collaborated with them to analyze repeated measures data from 8 new studies and as well as reanalyze data from their past published studies. The main statistical concern was whether their previous conclusions were still valid despite the fact the distributions of the observations were bimodal. Thus, I designed a series of analyses that included sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of their conclusions to perturbations in the observed data distribution and pooled analysis across similar experiments.\nProduct\n\nMann, T.

    "text": "The data this week comes from the arthistory data package\n\nThis dataset contains data that was used for Holland Stam’s thesis work, titled Quantifying art historical narratives. The data was collected to assess the demographic representation of artists through editions of Janson’s History of Art and Gardner’s Art Through the Ages, two of the most popular art history textbooks used in the American education system. In this package specifically, both artist-level and work-level data was collected along with variables regarding the artists’ demographics and numeric metrics for describing how much space they or their work took up in each edition of each textbook.\n\n\nThis package contains three datasets: - worksjanson: Contains individual work-level data by edition of Gardner’s art history textbook from 1963 until 2011. For each work, there is information about the size of the work and text as displayed in the textbook as well as details about the work’s medium and year created. Demographic data about the artist is also included. - worksgardner: Contains individual work-level data by edition of Gardner’s art history textbook from 1926 until 2020. For each work, there is information about the size of the work as displayed in the textbook as well as the size of the accompanying descriptive text. Demographic data about the artist is also included. - artists: Contains various information about artists by edition of Gardner or Janson’s art history textbook from 1926 until 2020. Data includes demographic information, space occupied in the textbook, as well as presence in the MoMA and Whitney museums.\n\n\nartists &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-01-17/artists.csv')\n\nRows: 3162 Columns: 14\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (8): artist_name, artist_nationality, artist_nationality_other, artist_g...\ndbl (6): edition_number, year, space_ratio_per_page_total, artist_unique_id,...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(artists)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n  artist_name   edition_number  year artist_nationality artist_nationality_other\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                   \n1 Aaron Douglas              9  1991 American           American                \n2 Aaron Douglas             10  1996 American           American                \n3 Aaron Douglas             11  2001 American           American                \n4 Aaron Douglas             12  2005 American           American                \n5 Aaron Douglas             13  2009 American           American                \n6 Aaron Douglas             14  2013 American           American                \n# ℹ 9 more variables: artist_gender &lt;chr&gt;, artist_race &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   artist_ethnicity &lt;chr&gt;, book &lt;chr&gt;, space_ratio_per_page_total &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   artist_unique_id &lt;dbl&gt;, moma_count_to_year &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   whitney_count_to_year &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_race_nwi &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\nartists %&gt;%\n  distinct(artist_name,year,moma_count_to_year,whitney_count_to_year) %&gt;% arrange(year) %&gt;% View()\n\n\nunique_artists &lt;- artists %&gt;%\n  distinct(artist_name,artist_nationality,artist_nationality_other,artist_gender,artist_race,artist_race_nwi) \n\n\nunique_artists %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = artist_gender)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\nunique_artists %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = artist_nationality)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()\n\n\n\nunique_artists &lt;- unique_artists %&gt;% separate(artist_nationality,sep = '-',into = c('FirstNationality','SecondNationality')) %&gt;%\n  mutate(multiNational = !is.na(SecondNationality)) \n\nWarning: Expected 2 pieces.

    "text": "The data this week comes from the arthistory data package\n\nThis dataset contains data that was used for Holland Stam’s thesis work, titled Quantifying art historical narratives. The data was collected to assess the demographic representation of artists through editions of Janson’s History of Art and Gardner’s Art Through the Ages, two of the most popular art history textbooks used in the American education system. In this package specifically, both artist-level and work-level data was collected along with variables regarding the artists’ demographics and numeric metrics for describing how much space they or their work took up in each edition of each textbook.\n\n\nThis package contains three datasets: - worksjanson: Contains individual work-level data by edition of Gardner’s art history textbook from 1963 until 2011. For each work, there is information about the size of the work and text as displayed in the textbook as well as details about the work’s medium and year created. Demographic data about the artist is also included. - worksgardner: Contains individual work-level data by edition of Gardner’s art history textbook from 1926 until 2020. For each work, there is information about the size of the work as displayed in the textbook as well as the size of the accompanying descriptive text. Demographic data about the artist is also included. - artists: Contains various information about artists by edition of Gardner or Janson’s art history textbook from 1926 until 2020. Data includes demographic information, space occupied in the textbook, as well as presence in the MoMA and Whitney museums.\n\n\nartists &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-01-17/artists.csv')\n\nRows: 3162 Columns: 14\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (8): artist_name, artist_nationality, artist_nationality_other, artist_g...\ndbl (6): edition_number, year, space_ratio_per_page_total, artist_unique_id,...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(artists)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n  artist_name   edition_number  year artist_nationality artist_nationality_other\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                   \n1 Aaron Douglas              9  1991 American           American                \n2 Aaron Douglas             10  1996 American           American                \n3 Aaron Douglas             11  2001 American           American                \n4 Aaron Douglas             12  2005 American           American                \n5 Aaron Douglas             13  2009 American           American                \n6 Aaron Douglas             14  2013 American           American                \n# ℹ 9 more variables: artist_gender &lt;chr&gt;, artist_race &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   artist_ethnicity &lt;chr&gt;, book &lt;chr&gt;, space_ratio_per_page_total &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   artist_unique_id &lt;dbl&gt;, moma_count_to_year &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   whitney_count_to_year &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_race_nwi &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\nartists %&gt;%\n  distinct(artist_name,year,moma_count_to_year,whitney_count_to_year) %&gt;% arrange(year) %&gt;% View()\n\n\nunique_artists &lt;- artists %&gt;%\n  distinct(artist_name,artist_nationality,artist_nationality_other,artist_gender,artist_race,artist_race_nwi) \n\n\nunique_artists %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = artist_gender)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\nunique_artists %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = artist_nationality)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()\n\n\n\nunique_artists &lt;- unique_artists %&gt;% separate(artist_nationality,sep = '-',into = c('FirstNationality','SecondNationality')) %&gt;%\n  mutate(multiNational = !is.na(SecondNationality)) \n\nWarning: Expected 2 pieces.
