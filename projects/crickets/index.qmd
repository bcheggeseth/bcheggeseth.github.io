After consulting for a Williams undergraduate student working on a genetics thesis, I became involved in the project to determine the association between the chemical "smell" of crickets and the mating between a pair of crickets. In addition to dealing with the dependence of repeated measures, I used survival analysis techniques to analyze the time until mating commenced.
