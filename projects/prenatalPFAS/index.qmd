In 2016, [Dr. Megan Romano](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/epidemiology/people/faculty/megan-romano/) of Dartmouth University contacted me regarding my expertise in longitudinal methods for childhood growth. I helped her write a grant proposal and started working as a statistical consulting on this approved grant that seeks to estimate the relationship between prenatal exposure to PFAS and childhood adiposity growth over time. I wrote the analysis plan, implemented it, and wrote the paper with Dr. Romano and other collaborators.
