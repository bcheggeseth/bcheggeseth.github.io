This project is a follow-up to a previous study to determine the association between the chemical "smell", cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile, of crickets and the mating between a pair of crickets. I assisted in a data-driven approach to align peaks from gas-chromatography for the cuticular hydrocarbons, the methodology to test paternity distribution within a female cricket's brood, and the relationship with the CHC profiles
