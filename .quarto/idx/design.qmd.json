These in turn raise ethical and moral questions, which motivate students' learning, making the subject matter more relevant and interesting.\"\n\n-   If possible, **choose data** that **does not reinforce negative stereotypes** about or systematically **exclude/erase** marginalized groups (e.g. binary gender, race and violence, etc.)\n    -   If not, discuss issues with social identity categories, how data can perpetuate social injustices, and data justice (see [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/))\n-   Rethink what is \"common knowledge\" (cultural) in terms of data context\n    -   Provide the necessary data context when presenting a new data set\n-   Along with real data, discuss **data ethics** and the **societal consequences** of data and modeling\n    -   Resources: [Movie: Coded Bias (currently on Netflix)](https://www.codedbias.com/), [Book: Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com), [Book: Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms,](https://wwnorton.com/books/Hello-World/), [Book: Algorithms of Oppression](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/)\n\nChance recently had three special issues on [human rights](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ucha20/31/1?nav=tocList), [climate change](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ucha20/30/4?nav=tocList), and [modern slavery](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ucha20/30/3?nav=tocList) that are ripe for examples to use in class.\n\n## Active Learning\n\nActive learning strategies\n\n-   \"involve students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing\" (Bonwell & Eisen, 1991, p. 2).\n\n-   require \"students to do meaningful learning activities and think about what they are doing\" (Prince, 2004, p. 1).\n\n-   \"cognitively engage students in building understanding at the highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy\" i.e., critical thinking skills (National Academies, 2017, p. 3-3).\n\n**Active learning provides multiple modes of engagement to support all students' learning**\n\n### Active Learning Strategies\n\n-   Entry/exit tickets or minute papers\n\n-   Think-Pair-Share\n\n-   Case studies or problem-based learning (guided problem-solving activity)\n\n-   Interactive demonstration\n\n-   Gallery walk stations to engage in topic\n\n-   [Jigsaw discussions](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive-teaching/jigsaw-collaborative-discussion-method/)\n\n-   Team-based inquiry-based (data analysis or simulation) activity\n\n## Collaboration & Group Structure\n\nIf collaboration is a learning outcome for your class, I recommend frequent structured small (3-4 person) group work.\n\n-   Working in a group is not trivial and is a skill that requires practice.\n-   Provide structure to prepare students to be part of a team\n\n### Intentional group creation\n\n-   I use random shuffling for short-term groups\n-   I am more intention when creating or helping to create long-term groups\n    -   Avoid isolating minoritized folks in long-term groups\n-   In any case, I provide a way to \"avoid\" another student if they feel unsafe (a barrier to learning)\n\n### Group Roles\n\nExplain (and maybe assign) roles that facilitate collaboration\n\n-   [Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL)](https://pogil.org/uploads/attachments/cjay281cc08qzw0x4ha9nt7wd-implementationguide.pdf) group roles\n    -   Facilitator/Project Manager\n    -   Recorder\n    -   Presenter/Spokesperson\n    -   Reflector\n    -   Resource Manager\n    -   Encourager\n\n### Assess Process and Product\n\n-   If focus is only on the product, then it is much more efficient to divide labor and not collaborate.\n-   Student assessments should incorporate the how well they strengthen and stretch the knowledge of the entire group.\n\n## Diverse Representation\n\n-   Highlight diverse [Past and Present Statisticians](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1176gCrz6JcqFS8iCs_VCdIKLB9r8VoBGjFzPDRURHUA/edit#gid=0)\n\n-   Talk about the history of white supremacy in Statistics\n\n    -   [Eugenics](https://nautil.us/issue/92/frontiers/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics)\n    -   [RA Fisher](https://www.newstatesman.com/international/science-tech/2020/07/ra-fisher-and-science-hatred)\n\n## Guides & Research\n\n[Universal Design of Instruction Resources](https://www.washington.edu/doit/programs/center-universal-design-education/postsecondary/universal-design-instruction) (curated by U of Washington)\n\n[LBGT+ resources for statisticians and data scientists](https://www.significancemagazine.com/culture/624-lgbt-resources-for-statisticians-and-data-scientists)\n\n[Brown University Inclusive & Active Teaching Resources](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/inclusive-teaching-through-active-learning#:~:text=Active%20learning%20strategies%20are%20also,2014%3B%20Hake%2C%201998).)\n\nFreeman, S. et al.
