After a two-year follow up, they [applied longitudinal growth mixture models (GMM) to detect any associations with declining eGFR patterns](https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/29/8/2200.short). While this statistical approach worked well for a short follow up, it was not as applicable for detecting the underlying cause with a longer 5-year follow up since individuals may start to decline at any point during the study.\n\nIn collaboration with nephrologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians, I came up with an alternative methodology (details forthcoming in publication) to detect an early kidney injury, the time at which an individual might switch from healthy kidney function to declining, unhealthy kidney function before being clinically diagnosed as having CKD.\n\nMacalester students, Alexander McCreight and Connie (Yixuan) Zhang, worked with me to implement this method to investigate potential exposures with early kidney injury. The first paper using this method is currently in review.\n\nWith my students, we will compare the potential conclusions from the original GMM methodology with this alternative method.\n\n**Product**\n\n-   **In Progress**\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"superhero","title":"Associations with Early Kidney Injuries","description":"Methodology research to detect exposure associations with early kidney injuries","image":"featured.jpg","image-alt":"Photo by Lon&Queta on flickr, https://www.flickr.com/photos/lonqueta/3680348838","categories":["Applied Collaboration","Correlated Data","Environmental Epidemiology","Ongoing"],"about":{"template":"solana"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
