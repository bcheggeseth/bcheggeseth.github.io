What is Equity? What is an Inclusion? What is an Inclusive \u0026amp; Equitable Classroom?    Everyone has their own concept of what diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) means to them. I provide my definitions that frame my pedagogical and professional work.\nWhat is Diversity? There are many ways in which people differ, both in terms of visiblee and invisible characteristics that influences individual and group identity and life experience. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to, race, ethnicity, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, socio-economic status, language, culture, national origin, religion/spirituality, age, (dis)ability, and military/veteran status.\nWe should celebrate our differences! We benefit from having learning spaces that include a diverse group of individuals and perspectives because our own lived experiences provide a narrow view of the world. We can deepen our understanding of our world, develop more creative and better solutions to important societal problems by having many ideas and approaches expressed.\nWhat is Equity? But it is not enough for everyone \u0026ldquo;a seat at the table.\u0026rdquo; Our society was built on the foundations of colonization and oppression, a caste system, which set the rules to benefit some groups, individuals, and identities over others. We must work to counter uneven social power and white supremacy.\nWe should make sure that everyone has the support and opportunity they need to succeed. Equity does not necessarily mean equal support and opportunity as we do not all experience the same barriers. We must put policies in place to actively respond to systematic racism and other forms of discrimination, bias, and harassment.\nWhat is an Inclusion? Inclusion means actively cultivating an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. An inclusive space can only be created once we are more aware of our unconscious biases and the roles we play in the social power dynamics, and have learned and are actively working to counter them.\nOnly with equity and inclusion can a diverse group of individuals thrive.\nWhat is an Inclusive \u0026amp; Equitable Classroom? An inclusive and equitable classroom is a space in which all students feel like they belong; they feel welcomed into the intellectual discussion, supported in their learning, and valued for their ideas and contributions.\nAll students have full access to learning opportunities, and the tools they need to do so successfully and meaningfully.\nStudents are treated fairly and equitably, not necessarily equally, no matter their background and intersecting identities (e.g. race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, ability, age,\u0026hellip;)\nNext: Cultivating an Inclusive and Equitable Class Climate\n","date":1611446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611446400,"objectID":"1358b5876ffc69e9c3c988934cd375b4","permalink":"https://bcheggeseth.github.io/inclusion/definitions/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/inclusion/definitions/","section":"inclusion","summary":"I define equity and inclusion to frame my pedagogical work.","tags":null,"title":"Definitions","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Table of Contents  Transparency \u0026amp; Accountability Develop Rapport with Students Trauma-Informed Teaching Cultivate Belonging Build Learning Community Other Guides \u0026amp; Research    Cultivating an inclusive classroom climate requires a growth mindset that is open to student feedback about their experiences and eager to experiment and make changes in the classroom.

These in turn raise ethical and moral questions, which motivate students’ learning, making the subject matter more relevant and interesting.”\n  If possible, choose data that does not reinforce negative stereotypes about or systematically exclude/erase marginalized groups (e.g. binary gender, race and violence, etc.)\n If not, discuss issues with social identity categories, how data can perpetuate social injustices, and data justice (see Data Feminism)    Rethink what is \u0026ldquo;common knowledge\u0026rdquo; (cultural) in terms of data context\n Provide the necessary data context when presenting a new data set    Along with real data, discuss data ethics and the societal consequences of data and modeling\n Resources: Movie: Coded Bias (currently on Netflix), Book: Weapons of Math Destruction, Book: Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms,, Book: Algorithms of Oppression    Chance recently had three special issues on human rights, climate change, and modern slavery that are ripe for examples to use in class.\nActive Learning Active learning strategies\n  \u0026ldquo;involve students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing\u0026rdquo; (Bonwell \u0026amp; Eisen, 1991, p. 2).\n  require \u0026ldquo;students to do meaningful learning activities and think about what they are doing\u0026rdquo; (Prince, 2004, p. 1).\n  \u0026ldquo;cognitively engage students in building understanding at the highest levels of Bloom\u0026rsquo;s taxonomy\u0026rdquo; i.e., critical thinking skills (National Academies, 2017, p. 3-3).\n  Active learning provides multiple modes of engagement to support all students' learning\nActive Learning Strategies   Entry/exit tickets or minute papers\n  Think-Pair-Share\n  Case studies or problem-based learning (guided problem-solving activity)\n  Interactive demonstration\n  Gallery walk stations to engage in topic\n  Jigsaw discussions\n  Team-based inquiry-based (data analysis or simulation) activity\n  Collaboration \u0026amp; Group Structure If collaboration is a learning outcome for your class, I recommend frequent structured small (3-4 person) group work.\n Working in a group is not trivial and is a skill that requires practice.

After a two-year follow up, they applied longitudinal growth mixture models (GMM) to detect any associations with declining eGFR patterns. While this statistical approach worked well for a short follow up, it was not as applicable for detecting the underlying cause with a longer 5-year follow up since individuals may start to decline at any point during the study.\nIn collaboration with nephrologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians, I came up with an alternative methodology (details forthcoming in publication) to detect an early kidney injury, the time at which an individual might switch from healthy kidney function to declining, unhealthy kidney function before being clinically diagnosed as having CKD.\nMacalester students, Alexander McCreight and Connie (Yixuan) Zhang, worked with me to implement this method to investigate potential exposures with early kidney injury.

This project focused on comparing methods for clustering longitudinal categorical data. The team created a tool for completing cluster analysis on such data using a variety of appropriate clustering methods. For each method, it produces visualizations and statistics to help interpret the clustering assignments. We also allow for comparing different clusters and producing clustering comparison statistics such as the adjusted Rand index. We include two data sets, but users could upload and analyze datasets of their choosing.\nThe original motivating data set for this project was data on healthcare utilization for cancer patients who moved between categories (Home, Hospital, Hospice, Nursing Facility). The goal was to see if we could detect similarities between patients based solely on their patterns of care.\nThis structure also appears in sleep stage data, like those produced by wearable technologies such as FitBit. If wore at night, an wearer is categorized into Wake, Light, Deep, or REM sleep when the device assumes sleep.

You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
